Project 1:
Voting With Blockchain

OVERVIEW:
To decrease organizational costs and increase voter turnout through Online Voting and to make it transparent develop a decentralized Voting system in Ethereum Blockchain. Where only Voting Admin can start, end elections, and add
Candidate and Voter details. Only Eligible voters can cast and delegate votes to Others. Display the winner at the end of the election.

Objective:
To develop a solution that offers decentralized nodes for electronic voting and that can be used to produce electronic systems for their end-to-end verification advantages build a smart contract in Solidity using the Remix tool in Ethereum Blockchain.
Technologies Used:
Solidity, Remix, Ganache

Project 2:
Job Portal

OVERVIEW:
To avoid middlemen and directly connect the Employers and Applicants develop a decentralized Job Portal Platform in Ethereum Blockchain.
Where only Employers can post Job Details and give a rating to the applicant. Once the Applicant registers themselves and creates their profile, they can Apply for open jobs.

Objective:
To develop a Job Portal Platform in Ethereum Blockchain which directly Connects the Employers and Applicants without any middlemen by building a smart contract in Solidity using the Remix tool.
Technologies Used:
Solidity, Remix, Ganache
